Project Overview

This project is a basic blockchain simulation implemented in Python. It demonstrates key blockchain concepts, including:

Block structure with transactions

SHA-256 hashing for data integrity

Proof-of-Work to make mining computationally intensive

Chain validation to detect tampering

The simulation mimics a blockchain by allowing new blocks to be added while ensuring data security through cryptographic hashing.

How to Run

Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed

Steps to Execute

Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd blockchain-simulation

Run the blockchain script:

python blockchain.py

The script will:

Create a genesis block.

Add new blocks with sample transactions.

Display the blockchain.

Validate the integrity of the blockchain.
